## Project Overview

This is a detailed explanation of "My First Awesome Project." Here, you can elaborate on the problem you tried to solve, the technologies you used, your approach, and the results.

### Technologies Used

*   **Python:** For core logic and data processing.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms.
*   **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.

### My Role and Contributions

I was responsible for the entire pipeline, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. I implemented the following key features:

*   Developed a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier.
*   Performed extensive exploratory data analysis to identify key features.
*   Created interactive visualizations to present the findings.

### Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was dealing with imbalanced datasets. I learned to apply techniques like SMOTE for oversampling and adjusted class weights to improve model performance. This project significantly enhanced my understanding of end-to-end machine learning workflows.

### Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to integrate this model into a web application using Flask and explore more advanced deep learning techniques for better accuracy.
